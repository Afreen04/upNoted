To prove yourself, you must travel to Madison, Wisconsin, by November 19 and compete in a contest. \n\nThe contest will test your wits, and your character, through a series of five puzzles. \n\nThe answers may be right under your nose. To stay in the game, you will need to support your favorite businesses with a purchase of $1 or more. With each separate purchase, you will earn a life. Those lives will come in handy as you play through the puzzles, so don’t let them fall below zero, or you’ll have to start over."
