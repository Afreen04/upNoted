Reality names you and four others as a potential heir, if you prove yourself worthy, to a fortune of $5,000. To prove yourself, you must travel to Madison, Wisconsin, by November 19 and compete in a contest. 

The contest will test your wits, and your character, through a series of five puzzles. 

The answers may be right under your nose. To stay in the game, you will need to support your favorite businesses with a purchase of $1 or more. With each separate purchase, you will earn a life. Those lives will come in handy as you play through the puzzles, so don’t let them fall below zero, or you’ll have to start over.</p><p>
